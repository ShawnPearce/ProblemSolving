                    <p>Customers, employees, and suppliers of Hudson's Bay are all affected by the company's operational challenges. Shoppers face declining store experiences and limited product availability, while employees are laid off due to the closure of multiple locations.</p>

                    <h3>Where and when did you see it?</h3>
                    <p>The issues are evident across Hudson's Bay locations such as both Burlington locations and in Toronto, including the flagship store on Queen Street and others in Yorkdale, Hillcrest Mall, and Fairview Pointe-Claire. These challenges have been ongoing since early 2025, culminating in the company's bankruptcy filing in March and subsequent store closures in April and May.</p>

                    <h3>What exactly is the problem?</h3>
                    <p>Hudson's Bay is grappling with significant financial and operational difficulties. The company has experienced a 33% decline in sales and a 50% drop in e-commerce revenue in 2024. Contributing factors include rapid increase cost of living, reduced consumer spending, trade tensions, and decreased foot traffic in downtown areas post-pandemic. These challenges led to the filing for bankruptcy protection and the decision to liquidate stores across Canada.</p>

                <div class="problem-card">
                    <h3>Why is this problem worth solving?</h3>
                    <p>Hudson's Bay's financial struggles, marked by declining sales and store closures, reflect a broader trend in Burlington and other communities, where rising costs and economic pressures are making it harder for people to afford once-common luxuries and even worse basic needs like clothing and appliances.</p>

            <h3>Research Insights</h3>
            <p>Through both primary and secondary research, I gained valuable insights into the shifting dynamics of retail consumer behavior, particularly in the context of large department stores such as Hudson's Bay. One of the most prominent observations is that consumers are rapidly changing the way they view traditional retail. The rise of e-commerce platforms most notably Amazon has transformed shopping habits, offering unmatched convenience, competitive pricing, and seamless user experiences. This shift became especially pronounced in the post-pandemic era, when online shopping became a necessity and, subsequently, a preference for many.</p>

            <p>The individual I interviewed, Carlos, offered a particularly thoughtful perspective. Surprisingly, he expressed little personal concern about the closure of major retail stores, stating that his shopping habits would remain unaffected. Instead, his primary concern was for the employees who might lose their jobs. This empathy points to a broader societal shift in consumer values: people are not only moving away from traditional shopping models but also becoming more socially conscious, aware of the human impact behind retail industry changes.</p>

            <p>My secondary research supported these anecdotal insights. Financial data shows a steady decline in revenue for large department stores over the past decade. The current business model appears unsustainable, particularly when compared to the efficiency and lower overhead of online retailers. Brick and mortar stores are burdened by high operational costs, including rent, staffing, and inventory management, which digital platforms can largely avoid. As a result, legacy retailers like Hudson's Bay struggle to compete on both price and convenience.</p>

            <p>Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as rising inflation, an increased cost of living, and changes in consumer priorities have made it even more difficult for traditional retail outlets to survive. Consumers are increasingly budget conscious, and online marketplaces provide them with easier access to lower cost alternatives.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, both the interview and the research reveal a retail landscape in transition. Consumer expectations have evolved, and the appeal of the in-store shopping experience has diminished. Unless traditional retailers can adapt to these changes by rethinking their value proposition, investing in digital infrastructure, or adopting hybrid business models their decline appears inevitable.</p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>Based on the results of the decision matrix, the highest-scoring concepts include 'Scan & Go Checkout', 'AI Personal Shopping Assistant', and 'Interactive Review Kiosks'. These ideas provide a strong balance between practical feasibility, innovative potential, and overall customer impact. Among them, 'Interactive Review Kiosks' emerged as the most well-rounded solution. This concept directly addresses the gap between online and in-store retail by integrating customer reviews and product insights into the physical shopping experience. It offers a seamless, tech-enhanced way for consumers to make informed decisions, much like they would online. Moreover, it encourages confidence in purchasing, reduces buyer hesitation, and aligns well with evolving customer expectations for transparency and convenience in the retail space. This solution can be implemented at scale with manageable cost and complexity, making it an ideal candidate for revitalizing traditional retail.</p>

            <h3>Selected HMW Question</h3>
            <div class="pov-statement">
                "How might we create hybrid shopping experiences that combine online and offline benefits?"
            </div>

            <h4>Why This Question is Valuable</h4>
            <p>This question addresses the core challenges identified in our problem such as the fundamental value proposition gap between online and offline retail. Rather than trying to compete directly with online retailers on their strengths the approach creates entirely new value propositions that leverage the best of both worlds.</p>

            <p>This is valuable because it accepts that online shopping has permanent advantages rather than fighting against them. It opens possibilities for solutions like augmented reality, same day pickup, personalized in store consultations with online research integration and community spaces with digital enhancement. It can simultaneously serve budget conscious consumers, employees, and retailers.</p>

            <p>These solutions developed here could transform the entire retail industry rather than just helping individual stores to survive. It positions traditional retailers to evolve with changing consumer behavior rather than resist it.</p>

            <p>This question is likely to generate breakthrough innovations that could revitalize physical retail by creating experiences that neither online nor traditional offline shipping can provide alone.</p>
